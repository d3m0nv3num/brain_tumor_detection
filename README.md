# brain_tumor_detection
an algorithm made for brain tumor detection using the kaggle dataset as the data for this project(python syntax, jupyter notebook ).
please note: for using the code the changes according to the address of the data set directory has to be made.
imagedatagenerator function for image augmentation is used.
The activation function for the final layer is sigmoid which can be changed to relu,number of epochs is 10 and batch size can be changed for trail to attain more optimal results.
